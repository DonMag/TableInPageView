# TableInPageView

Swift / iOS example...

Embedding a table view in a page of a page view controller, calculating the row height so the table initially displays with only "full rows" showing - that is, we don't want to see a half-row at the bottom.

Four pages - first two have table views. 

First one uses a fixed number of rows.

Second uses a "minimum height" for the rows.

Third and Fourth pages just have other layouts.
